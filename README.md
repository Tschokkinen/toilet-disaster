# toilet-disaster
An old mobile game demo.

<p><b>Platform:</b> Unity (tested on version 2020.3.44f1)</p>

<a href="https://github.com/Tschokkinen/toilet-disaster/tree/main/Assets/Scripts">Go to C# folder.</a>

This project was used several years ago to learn how Unity works and how to program with C#. Therefore, some programming decisions may seem overly complicated. :)
<p>
Programming was done by me and graphics by Juha Toivonen.
Game mechanics were designed together.</p>
